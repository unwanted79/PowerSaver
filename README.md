# PowerSaver
This is a power saving project designed to discharge a laptop once the battery is full and begin the charge when it falls below 15%.<br>
Due to changing jobs and varied permissions I've had to write the code in C#, VBA and ASP.net. The project requires the purchase of a USB relay along with any additional cosmetic or safety hardware such as cable, a socket box and USB adapter.

## Hardware requirements and wiring

## Software requirements
The driver for the USB relay is required along with some software to write the code that may include anything from Office, which could utilise Access; Excel; Outlook, or some other IDE like Visual Studio where another language of personal choice could be used.

## Set up 1 - C#
