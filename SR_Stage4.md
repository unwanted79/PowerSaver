## Stage 4 - Set up the relay
You'll need to install the drivers for the relay. I've attached them to this project. See <a href="CH341SER.zip">CH341SER.zip</a><br>
Right click the start menu on your home PC and select Device Manager<br>
Expand the Ports (COM &amp; LPT) node<br>
Right click the USB-SERIAL CH340 item and select Properties. This assumes you have connected the USB Relay to your computer.<br>
Navigate to the Port Settings tab and check the settings are the same as illustrated below.<br>
